            <h3> ▶ A Bezier curve is a mathematically defined curve used in two-dimensional
                graphic applications. The curve is defined by four points: the initial position and the terminating
                position (which are called "anchors") and two separate middle
                points (which are called "handles").
            </h3>

            <h3>▶ Bezier curve was first invented by Pierre Bezier. Due to its nice properties, Bezier curves are widely
                used
                in
                engineering designs and CAD packages.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                ▶ The curve is specified by a set of control points. Position of control points controls the shape of
                the
                curve.
                Fitting a
                single curve of the higher degree to all the control points is difficult. Normally, the big curve is
                approximated by
                joining piecewise polynomials of lower degree, which approximates few control points only.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                ▶ Local control: Repositioning one control point changes the entire curve.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                ▶ Global control: Repositioning one control point does changes the entire curve.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                ▶ With cubic polynomials, Bezier curve can approximate any number of control points. In the Bezier
                curve,
                the
                degree of
                polynomial depends on a number of control points used to generate curve segment.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                ▶ In the Bezier curve, the degree of the polynomial is always one less than a number of control points.
                Figure below shows
                Bezier curves with three, four and five control points having a degree of polynomial two, three and
                four,
                respectively.</h3>

                first and last
                segments.</h3>
            <h3>
                ▶ The slope of the derivative at the beginning is along the line joining the first two points and slope

                of
                automobiles,
                engineering, architectures, and aeronautics objects. Few of the applications are listed where the Bezier

                used to model the shapes.
